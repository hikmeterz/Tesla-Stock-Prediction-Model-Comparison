
# Tesla Stock Price Prediction: A Comparison of ARIMA, RNN, and LSTM Models

This repo contains a research study that utilizes different time series models to predict Tesla stock prices. 

**Models Used:**

* **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average):** A statistical model for time series data.
* **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network):** A type of deep learning model commonly used for time series data.
* **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** A variation of RNNs designed to handle long-term dependencies better.

**Project Steps:**

1. **Data Preparation:** Tesla stock data is preprocessed and cleaned.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The characteristics of the dataset are examined and visualizations are created.
3. **Model Training:** Each of the three models is trained and optimized on the training dataset.
4. **Prediction and Evaluation:** Models are applied to the test dataset, and their performance is assessed using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and RÂ².
5. **Results:** Model performances are compared and discussed.

**Repo Contents:**

* **Tesla.csv:** CSV file containing Tesla stock data.
* **Tesla_Stock_Prediction.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing all the code and analysis.
